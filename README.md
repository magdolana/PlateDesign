###Making mobile applications

####Before you bake mobile application
1) Apache Cordova makes it possible for us to use the same code (html, js and css) to build mobile applications.
You just need to install different platform SDKs.

2) More API documentation can be found at this url:
http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.5.0//guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-Line%20Interface

4) npm install -g cordova

// Install cordova at the folder 'cordova'

// if you don't have the permission please use 'sudo' to grant permission

5) cordova create lsseed com.example.lsseed LsSeed 

// Create the framework App named lsseed with default settings.

#### Replace the source code in 'www' folder
6) cd lsseed/www

// Switch to 'www' folder

7) rm -r index.html js css img

// Delete the index.html, js, img and css folders inside 'www'.folder.

8) copy our lsseed source files in folder 'ls_seed/ls_seed_source/*' into 'cordova/lsseed/www' folder
